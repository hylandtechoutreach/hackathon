# Hack Heist
An activity, mainly for the explorer track. Students will have to participate in activities and explore to unlock the prizes.

## Goals
The main purpose of this activity is to keep participants engaged, even if they are not totally invested in their projects. It should be the right amount of distratcting - it should not be the sole focus of their experience at the event, but it should provide an additional opportunity for enrichment.

Hints can be given throughout if needed, so that by the end of the event, it's almost entirely certain that the big prize will be unlocked. However, it may happen much sooner!

## Big Prize
A file cabinet filled with [100 tiny toys](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B4DK1MSJ/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=AWMTAE37MX5JD&th=1) (maybe throw a few extra in there). The file cabinet is locked. Unlocking the file cabinet leads each participant to receive one toy.

## Tagout Box
The key to unlock the file cabinet is itself locked within [this box](https://www.amazon.com/QWORK-Lockout-Portable-Capacity-Security/dp/B0C6248V7H?crid=1VE9UC2G15H8I&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fBnTDlIWkx600UCSe8CZ52pMLBbiup3YF4ipznabB2YPkyTyrVzUPeKnFGE2N3wp5mR34Z82Yw-g2j9ucriF59vmt_ZVl8RpnN0_I6VD8cdt59veeCc_F_KwgjK-I1M2kkFGlPHrAx6g3UG3Jz5TnQMI4iVLUztAZ2xUceLslrQ3K-CcLNhr_HC8yLgJ4L3smAgzT3qcYuT5tePiPDYd88FaGIK1Yq5PiIXMKqpGy7e5eLEwsg5HFuEW9Q9kGxlB4-edeynTS6dTmutEvb39jcgIAA29FZ960hGoBC_O3Oo.NGbZ2PMf3SEEX_e97ZboF3PY46DeIUCpWlc_Wua7Mtw&dib_tag=se&keywords=transparent+padlock+box&qid=1731338913&sprefix=transparent+padlock+box%2Caps%2C128&sr=8-33).

The locked box is locked by EIGHT padlocks, each requiring an individual key.

## Padlocks - Eight Keys
[These padlocks](https://www.amazon.com/VIP-Home-Essentials-Durable-Individually/dp/B07423DRDQ?crid=3RHNG8193ER3N&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dismf1Xm6-3UTb-95KrRjwyavfXCBB2bLw61aCJPDx24zgBorf-XmrIgMjyxlBJsFx8IRPYMbSTl8eou5J7-iiij6UJJIT9byWvc7N3YqskTkiwOMBMag02iNMehPFgzPYUWyA0rAwMknrnF6lHhBflmabLtrM-MtUa50ADV6RiAeie4GhZu-SZAWc3mJAQoJpP1fLSRk8h3VBcCEvj-ef2L8Zk5OeJbzgKPAosGiEr_U6am0RgEqkKOgVVJQ9bxNoRxETNM_ETYtCnhEyHq3gCGQhjl7Ebtm6_3ue_8WeI.SRxAe1Uk0T4OzlWze0FRZCaGC-wuLjvJh2OVUNHqvuY&dib_tag=se&keywords=padlock%2Bset%2Bnot%2Bkeyed%2Balike&qid=1731341371&sprefix=padlock%2Bset%2Bnot%2Bkeyed%2Balik%2Caps%2C145&sr=8-4&th=1) will be used to secure the tagout box. They keys are distributed as follows:

### Free Keys
SIX of the EIGHT keys will be floating as primary targets. There will be two of each category:

1. Explorer's Keys - these two keys will be hidden somewhere in the building - IN PLAIN SIGHT - WITHIN DESIGNATED AREAS
2. Mentor's Keys - these two keys must be attained through social engineering (aka writing a nice thank you note to a mentor and then they give you the key)
3. The Keys of the Chosen Ones - these two keys will be given to random students, in their welcome packets, within an envelope, with instructions

### Boxed Keys
For the remaining two keys, there is an additional layer of security - as well as additional rewards.

## Scavenger's Key
This is a [box](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCYHTVT4/ref=ox_sc_act_title_7?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1) locked by a [combination padlock](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QFLPKQZ/ref=ox_sc_act_title_6?smid=A2HY45RO2P7HOW&th=1). The combination will only be revealed after finding all the keywords hidden throughout the event, and entered into the online portal.

These keywords will be discoverable by exploring the content on the website, by attending sessions, by participating in activities, and solving code puzzles online. For example, these keywords could be hidden:

- On the Rules page
- On a PowerPoint slide
- In a code comment for an example
- Behind a game that must be beaten
- Behind a broken application that must be fixed

Upon finding all of the keywords and receiving the combination, a participant (or group of participants) can unlock the box to attain the Scavenger's Key, as well as some [Japanese candy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CZL4CJZP/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=AMS68DCXFRW9Z&th=1).

## Puzzler's Key
Like the scavenger's key, this is a [box](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCYHTVT4/ref=ox_sc_act_title_7?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1) locked by a [combination padlock](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QFLPKQZ/ref=ox_sc_act_title_6?smid=A2HY45RO2P7HOW&th=1). Each individual number for the combination can be found by completing the four paper puzzles. Each one will reveal a number.

Some example puzzles:

- A message encrypted using a rot cipher
- A message hidden in a drawing on a pixel grid
- A logic puzzle of some kind
