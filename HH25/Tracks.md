# Tracks
Participants may need some guidance throughout the weekend. Choosing a track can help them figure out which path to take; which workshops to attend, which projects to choose, and how to operate in general. Participants will not be beholden to the choice they make - it is only meant to support them, not constrain them. These are currently ideas; not confirmed.

## Explorer
This is essentially the same track as 2023. The "newbies" who want to have fun and gain exposure! They may need encouragement from mentors and facilitators, but the technical guidance can be much simpler. It is recommended that they attend as many sessions as they can. If these students have a positive experience, then we have succeeded with them.

## Creator
This would be a participant who really wants to build something amazing. They want to dedicate the time they have during the event to this goal. Perhaps this is because they would like to win the competition; or maybe they just want to create a product to change the world, or just because they love it. These students do not need to attend a single workshop - but they could use mentor guidance and support from a technical perspective. If we set them up to develop a great project (or even the beginnings of one), we have succeeded with them.

## Scholar
This participant is here to truly level up. They already have some skills, but they want to grow them and learn even more. They can do this by attending sessions, but they can also learn by doing. These students may need a little more guidance than the Creator group, but more on a "here are some learning resources" level than a "here's how to do something" level. If they gain a lot of experience and learn a lot by the end of the weekend, we have succeeded with them.
