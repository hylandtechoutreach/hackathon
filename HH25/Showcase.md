# Showcase
The competition aspect of this year's hackathon will be different than the competitions of the past. There will not be "judges" in the traditional sense, and there will not be first place and second place teams. The goal is to create an equal opportunity for all teams, regardless of their experience levels, to be awarded for their hard work and ingenuity. There could be many ways to accomplish this; this is one proposal.

## Project Submission
Teams will submit their projects in a similar way to the first round submissions of the past, but a little more broad. Instead of being required to submit a video, or a document, they will be able to submit an "artifact" of some kind. This could be a project demo, a presentation, a document, a collection of images, an audio recording, or really anything else they would like - as long as it is accessible via web link. The guidelines for this will be clarified. Project submissions will be done through an online portal of some kind. Tentatively, project submissions will be due at 5pm on Sunday.

## Wall of Fame / Showcase Viewing
After teams have submitted their artifacts, they will be surfaced online and available for viewing. This could mean that their video appears on the "Wall of Fame" thing, or that a link to their website is made available for people to explore. Tentatively, this is scheduled to take place for one hour - from 5-6pm Sunday. This can be less sophisticated technologically (e.g., Microsoft Form -> Live Excel Sheet for viewing), or it could be a more elaborate portal. The process will need to be clarified further.

### Mentor Review
During this period, mentors who choose "showcase" shifts will have a chance to view all the artifacts. They will be able to share their nominations for awards, and winners will be determined for various categories. Also in consideration will be notes from other mentors who were helping teams during the work period - the actual teamwork, resilience, and creativity of the development should be valued in addition to the artifact at the end. Essentially, process and product should be weighted equally. This process can be further clarified.

### Student Choice
The Wall of Fame should be available for all students to view during the viewing period. To encourage them to view the other team projects, each team can be given a number of votes to cast (for projects that are NOT their own). The artifact with the most votes, at the end of the period, will win the "Student Choice" award. Teams will only be eligible to win this award if each member votes for other projects in the showcase. There should be a verification process for this to ensure that participants are voting in good faith. This can be cut if it ends up being too difficult logistically / technologically. Voting may take place on Discord, or maybe even on paper????????? That would be crazy but might make the most sense.

### Live Viewing
In addition to the web, there should be some way to surface the Wall of Fame in a live setting. Perhaps a mentor can look through the website in the auditorium, and explore the various submissions. Importantly, this portion should NOT involve live student presentations - that may happen later.

## Awards
The winners of a few different awards will be determined during this period and the subsequent dinner portion. Prizes are TBD for these awards.

### Marquee Awards
These are the "bigger" categories. These should be made known to participants before and during the event, to help inform their work throughout the weekend. At this point, these are all simply ideas.

- **Most Impressive MVP**: this takes the place of the traditional "first place" award - basically, the "best" final product. This takes into account the actual functionality that was accomplished, and weighs that above most other things.
- **Most Creative Idea**: this is more about the quality and novelty of the team's idea. It does not necessarily consider how much the product is "working" at the end.
- **Best Teamwork**: this is really about the process. This should award a team that was resilient, worked well together, learned a lot, had a positive attitude, and ended up with something good by the end.
- **Student Choice**: this is whichever project wins the votes of the most students. There should be no overlap between this and the other categories.
- **Mentor Choice**: this is a reserved category for any nominations from mentors that really deserve a win. This could be for anything - depends on the mentor(s) who advocate for the team win.

### Superlative Awards
These can be given to teams or individuals who demonstrate exceptional character throughout the weekend. These should NOT be shared with students ahead of time as each one may or may not be given - it depends on the teams and the projects. As with above, these are all simply ideas. Just for fun, each one can have a Cleveland Icon parallel.

- The Points Don't Matter (Drew Carey): Whichever individual or team brings the most humor to the event
- Beauty & Grace (Halle Berry): Whichever project has the prettiest UI
- Trailblazer (Carl Stokes): Whichever team or individual went the furthest out of their comfort zone
- Heartstrings (Tracy Chapman): Whichever individual or team demonstrated most heart, passion, and compassion
- Against All Odds (LeBron James + 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers): Whichever team thought they were down and out at one point, but made it back and submitted something great
- Quick Study (Garrett Morgan): Whichever individual or team learned the most over the course of the event
- Coach (Paul Brown): Whichever individual demonstrated an extraordinary ability to help others, either on their team or on other teams
- Night Owl(s) (Vanessa Bayer): Whichever individual(s) got the least amount of sleep
- Future Millionaire (John D. Rockefeller): Whichever team or project showed the most business sense

## Prizes
I got an Amazon catalog in the mail, and it has a lot of fun slightly smaller prizes. I would sort of rather have a larger number of smaller prizes (vs a smaller number of larger prizes). With the submitted budget of 2000, I think we could do up to 15 "bigger" prizes that are up to $100 each, and then 10 prizes that are up to $50 each:

3 Marquee Award winners x 5 participants per team = 15 participants x $100 prize = $1,500

10 Superlative Award winners x $50 prize = $500
