# Showcase
The competition aspect of this year's hackathon will be different than the competitions of the past. There will not be "judges" in the traditional sense, and there will not be first place and second place teams. The goal is to create an equal opportunity for all teams, regardless of their experience levels, to be awarded for their hard work and ingenuity.

## Project Submission
Teams will submit their projects in a similar way to the first round submissions of the past, but a little more broad. Instead of being required to submit a video, or a document, they will be able to submit an "artifact" of some kind. This could be a project demo, a presentation, a document, a collection of images, an audio recording, or really anything else they would like - as long as it is accessible via web link. Project submissions will be done through an online portal of some kind. Project submissions will be due at 5pm on Sunday.

## Wall of Fame / Showcase Viewing
After teams have submitted their artifacts, they will be surfaced online and available for viewing. This could mean that their video appears on the "Wall of Fame" thing, or that a link to their website is made available for people to explore. This is scheduled to take place for one hour - from 5-6pm Sunday. This can be less sophisticated technologically (e.g., Microsoft Form -> Live Excel Sheet for viewing), or it could be a more elaborate portal depending on bandwidth.

### Mentor Review
During this period, mentors who choose "showcase" shifts will have a chance to view all the artifacts. They will rank their top three for the **Most Impressive MVP** and **Most Outstanding Magnum Opus** awards. The weighted votes will be tallied, and this will determine the winners in these categories.

During this time, mentors and staff will also be able to submit nominations for any of the superlative awards. Notes from previous mentors will also be considered for these awards.

### Student Choice
The Wall of Fame should be available for all students to view during the viewing period. To encourage them to view the other team projects, each team can be given a number of votes to cast (for projects that are NOT their own). The artifact with the most votes, at the end of the period, will win the "Student Choice" award. Teams will only be eligible to win this award if each member votes for other projects in the showcase. There should be a verification process for this to ensure that participants are voting in good faith.

### Live Viewing
In addition to the web, there will be some way to surface the Wall of Fame in a live setting. Perhaps a mentor can look through the website in the auditorium, and explore the various submissions. Importantly, this portion should NOT involve live student presentations.

## Awards
The winners of a few different awards will be determined during this period and the subsequent dinner portion. Prizes are to be determined.

### Marquee Awards
These are the "bigger" categories. These should be made known to participants before and during the event, to help inform their work throughout the weekend.

- **Most Impressive MVP**: Mentors choose the project that impresses them the most. They will consider actual working functionality, as well as technical ingenuity and overall quality.
- **Most Outstanding Magnum Opus**: Mentors choose the project that demonstrates the best possible work of its creators. The project stands out in the showcase for its unique perspective, engaging presentation, and effortful originality. 
- **Student Choice**: Students vote on their favorite projects in the showcase. After the other two Marquee Awards have been given, the remaining project with the most student votes wins this award.

### Superlative Awards
These can be given to teams or individuals who demonstrate exceptional character throughout the weekend. These may be shared, but students should know they are not guaranteed. Just for fun, each one can have a Cleveland Icon parallel.

- **The Points Don't Matter** (Drew Carey): Whichever individual or team brings the most humor to the event
- **Beauty & Grace** (Halle Berry): Whichever team develops a project with the prettiest aesthetic
- **Trailblazer** (Carl Stokes): Whichever individual or team went the furthest out of their comfort zone
- **Heartstrings** (Tracy Chapman): Whichever individual or team demonstrated most heart, passion, and compassion
- **Against All Odds** (LeBron James + 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers): Whichever team thought they were down and out at one point, but made it back and submitted something great
- **Quick Study** (Garrett Morgan): Whichever individual or team learned the most over the course of the event
- **Coach** (Paul Brown): Whichever individual demonstrated an extraordinary ability to help others, either on their team or on other teams
- **Night Owl(s)** (Ghoulardi and/or Vanessa Bayer): Whichever individual(s) stayed up working the latest
- **Future Millionaire** (John D. Rockefeller): Whichever individual or team showed the most business sense

## Prizes
Each team member who wins a Marquee Award will be given a choice between prizes at around a $110 value. This means that the maximum possible budget for Marquee prizes is $1,650. The remaining budget can go toward the Superlative prizes. These prizes will be a maximum of $55 value. There can be at least 5 Superlative Awards given. Additional Superlative Awards can be given in the event that the total number of Marquee prizes is less than 15. There should be some budget buffer just in case there are unforeseen price increases or anything like that.
