# Participant Registration Process
Students will need to register in order to participate.

## Pre-Registration Period: Oct 18-Dec 8, 2024
This period can start as early as now, and go until the registration opens. Students can fill out this form: https://forms.office.com/r/Jkdt01wmDs1

This is basically just a way for students to show they are interested. It gives us a specific group to target when real registration opens. Pre-registered students can get first dibs on the registration (maybe a day before, maybe just notified early).

## Registration Open: Dec 9, 2024-Jan 7, 2025
Actual registration will be like it has been in the past. A relatively simple form. From there, participants will be confirmed once they have a parent/guardian consent form or a participant consent form. And they can be added to the roster.

Potentially, students will want to register after registration has closed - accommodations can be made depending on the case.

## CMSD Students
It is possible Chelsey Cook Kohn will help coordinate some students to come from CMSD. If this happens, we can potentially reserve spots for them. We will still ask that each of them submits their own registration form - we can potentially go into schools to help with this. They will also DEFINITELY need the consent form on file in order to participate.

## Capacity: 100
We are planning for a cap of 100. I think allowing for 120 registrants total will allow us to have around 100 actual attendees. It is also possible we only get like 30 people... that would be fine too! We can confirm final numbers for food and potentially adjust award plans as needed.
