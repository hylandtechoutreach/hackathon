# Mentors
_As you develop your burgeoning enterprise, you may find that you require the sage wisdom of an advisor._

Hyland employees will assume the role of mentor during the event, and guide you through your experience.

- They have a variety of skill sets and topic expertise
- They will also act as supervisors throughout the weekend
- They will not do your project for you - but they can guide you along the way
- You can reach them on [Discord](../DiscordInformation.md) by tagging `@mentors`
- You can set up a Zoom call with mentors if needed
- You can also find them in-person at the Mentor Room

_Whether virtual or in-person, participants should never be one-on-one with mentors._

Both virtual and in-person mentors will be available to help, so feel free to reach out to either!

_More mentor information coming soon!_
