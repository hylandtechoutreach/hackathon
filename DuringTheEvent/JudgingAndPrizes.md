# Judging & Prizes
_Face the ultimate judgment, and reap the splendid rewards of your impeccable efforts._

#### ENTRY ROUND SUBMISSION
[Click here to submit your video pitch by **1pm ET on Sunday**!](https://forms.gle/1C5tdUv1ZaMbuEbK6)

## Rounds
There will be two rounds of judging: the **Entry Round**, and the **Final Round**.

### Entry Round: Video Pitch
For this round, you should record a **2-3 minute video pitch** that describes the capabilities of your software product. Explain your project, demonstrate the features, and sell it to the judges!

The deadline to submit a video is **Sunday at 1pm ET**, so make sure you upload your video and [submit the link](https://forms.gle/1C5tdUv1ZaMbuEbK6) by then!

#### Recording Your Video
There are several ways to record your team presenting your project; feel free to use whatever works best for you. If you are participating in-person, you can use the small **quiet rooms** to record. That said, the judges understand that recording conditions will not be ideal, so they won't dock you points for background noise!

If you don't have much experience with video editing, Hyland recommends using a **Zoom Meeting**. Start by [downloading and installing Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4415294177549-Downloading-the-Zoom-desktop-client-and-mobile-app), then follow [these instructions](https://instruction.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/2020-09/ZoomRecordPres.pdf) from The George Washington University:

1. Launch Zoom, and start up a new meeting
1. Start your webcam video
1. Open your presentation materials, including your project
1. Share your screen
1. Click Record
1. Start presenting
1. End the meeting

That should be all you need to do! Once you have your video file, you'll be able to upload it.

#### Uploading Your Video
You will be required to submit a **link** to your video using a platform of your choice. You can host it anywhere you'd like, as long as it is accessible to the judges through a URL. There are a few options for this:

- **Google Drive:** If you have a Google account, you can upload your video to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) and share via link. [Click here for a walkthrough.](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-share-a-video-on-google-drive)
- **YouTube:** If you have a YouTube account, you can upload your video to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)! Feel free to post it as "Unlisted" if you don't want it to be fully public; but it must be accessible through a link.
- **ShareBase:** If you do not have any accounts, you can upload the video to a ShareBase folder:
  - [Click here to open the folder](https://app.sharebase.com/#/folder/1656143/share/3-AxI6WesCYhcQE2cM8eSkwpv8GwI)
  - Drag the file into the folder, or click the Upload button
  - Once the file is uploaded, click on it to open it
  - Copy the link to the file from the browser address bar
  - _Note that if you upload your video here, it will be visible to other Hackathon participants!_
