# Discord Information
The 2022 Hybrid Hyland Hackathon will use [Discord](https://discord.com/) as a way for students and mentors to communicate during the event.

## Invite Link
Join the server by clicking [this link](https://discord.gg/tu9H9yfRkx).

## Parental Consent Form Agreement 
As noted in the parental consent form that was signed by Parents or Guardians, each student has agreed to the following regarding the use of Discord: 

>I agree and understand that Hyland may provide for the use of certain unaffiliated third party websites or applications (“Third Party Sites”) in connection with the Program. I understand that use of these Third Party Sites is optional. If I choose to permit my child(ren) to use such Third Party Sites, I further understand and agree that: (i) the Third Party Site may collect personal information directly from my child(ren) subject to the terms and conditions (including an applicable privacy policy) available on the Third Party Site; and (ii) Hyland does not control these Third Party Sites and is not responsible for their information collection practices.

## Additional Guidelines
- The usage of Discord is **not** required. If you do not want to use it, you will still be able to participate in the Hackathon.
- You must use your _real first and last name_ when communicating on Discord. If we see an account that does not have a real student name, the account will be kicked out.
    - Follow [these instructions](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames) to update your Server Nickname.
- If you say anything inappropriate, you will be banned from the server and may be removed from the event.
- Please be respectful of all attendees and mentors while communicating on Discord.
- Mentors will check Discord frequently, so feel free to post any time! Tag the `@mentors` role to reach them.

## Server Categories & Channels
There are several channels in the server. Please be mindful of each channel's purpose.

### PREP CHANNELS
These channels are meant to be used before the event begins.

#### find-a-team
Use this channel to find a team! Feel free to post your name, school, grade level, and coding experience. Then, try to find other attendees who would make good teammates.

#### event-questions
Use this channel to ask questions about the logistics of the event, before it begins.

### EVENT CHANNELS
These channels are meant to be used during the event.

#### announcements
Mentors will post important messages in this channel. Attendees will not be able to post.

#### general
This channel is reserved for general chat. Feel free to use it to talk about the Hackathon with fellow attendees!

#### questions
Attendees should ask questions about their project development in this channel. Mentors (and other attendees) will do their best to answer these questions. Note that the answers to the questions should be focused on learning; try to use leading questions or background explanations rather than simply providing code solutions.

#### git-help
This channel is for questions specifically related to git.

### TEAM CHANNELS
Once teams are formed, the Team Channels category will include channels for each individual team (if necessary). These will be especially helpful for virtual attendees.
