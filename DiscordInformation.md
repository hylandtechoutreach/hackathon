## Server Categories & Channels
There are several channels in the server. Please be mindful of each channel's purpose.

### PREP CHANNELS
These channels are meant to be used before the event begins.

#### find-a-team
Use this channel to find a team! Feel free to post your name, school, grade level, and coding experience. Then, try to find other attendees who would make good teammates.

#### event-questions
Use this channel to ask questions about the logistics of the event, before it begins.

### EVENT CHANNELS
These channels are meant to be used during the event.

#### announcements
Mentors will post important messages in this channel. Attendees will not be able to post.

#### general
This channel is reserved for general chat. Feel free to use it to talk about the Hackathon with fellow attendees.

#### questions
Attendees should ask questions about their project development in this channel. Mentors (and other attendees) will do their best to answer these questions. Note that the answers to the questions should be focused on learning; try to use leading questions or background explanations rather than simply providing code solutions.

#### counting
This channel is for counting. Post sequential whole numbers without anyone posting twice in a row.

### TEAM CHANNELS
Once teams are formed, the Team Channels category will include channels for each individual team (if necessary). These will be especially helpful for virtual attendees.
