# Tracks
Each participant should select one track to follow for the duration of the event. There will be features and functions designed specifically for members of each track, but don't worry; selecting one track or another will not limit your possibilities. The tracks are simply meant to guide you through the Hackathon and give you an idea of what to do.

Members of a team can all choose the same track, or all chose different ones. Anything is possible.
