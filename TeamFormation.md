# Team Formation
When it comes time for the competition to begin, the first thing you'll want to do is form a team!

- You can arrive with a team already formed
- You can also establish a team during the event, but...
  - We strongly encourage teams to be formed ahead of time
- Teams can have up to **5 members**
- Teams do not have to be from the same school
