# Workshop: Building a Website
This workshop introduces students to the world of HTML & CSS using Replit.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Understand how web browsers render HTML text to create websites
- Create and modify projects using Replit
- Collaborate on Replit with the Multiplayer feature
- Build their own custom websites
- Explore resources for further learning
- Be empowered to create substantial websites

## Web Demonstration
Start by briefly explaining how web browsers use HTML & CSS to render websites. The main goal of this demonstration is to give students some context about how the web works, as well as a basic understanding of HTML elements.

Follow these steps to conduct the demonstration:

1. Ask the students if they know what HTML and CSS are
1. Ask the students if they have ever been to a website
    - Ask them what their favorite websites are
1. Go to [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/) in Google Chrome
1. Ask students for an article to visit
    - Use the [Hackathon article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) if no one has any good ideas
1. Right click and select "View page source"
1. Explain that all the text in the source (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is what builds the nice-looking website
1. Go back to the Wikipedia page itself
1. Right click some of the text and select "Inspect"
1. Highlight some of the basic elements like `<h1></h1>`, `<p></p>`, `<img />`, and `<a></a>`
1. Explain that different elements appear differently on the site
1. Change up some of the text for fun
1. Update styles for fun as well

After this, students will hopefully have the background knowledge necessary to start learning how to build a website from the ground up.

## Replit Introduction
Next, [introduce Replit](ReplitIntroduction.md). Give students the chance to create an account, login, and fork the [starter project](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/WebWave#index.html).

## Code-Along: Web Wave
Building off of the forked starter project, create a website about synthwave by following the [code-along instructions](WebWaveCodeAlong.md). Encourage students to use their own text, images, and other assets during the activity.

By the end of the activity, the code should look something like [this](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/WebWaveComplete).

## Resources
Go over the many [resources](WebResources.md) available to the students. Emphasize that if they want to figure out how to do anything in HTML or CSS, they should search the internet. They are also welcome to ask mentors for assistance.

Feel free to walk through some of the resources if there is student interest. This could include:

- Adding a functional button using JavaScript
- Embedding a YouTube video
- Setting a custom font
- Adding a text shadow or color gradient
- Creating a transition, transform, or animation

There is a [showcase website](https://moreweb.hylandoutreach.repl.co/) that demonstrates some of the further learning possibilities.

## Formative Assessment: Blooket
With any time that remains, facilitate the [Blooket quiz game](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/63977c6ede14514387efb6fc).

End the workshop with a few words of encouragement for the students. They should feel empowered to go out and code something fun, unique, and rewarding.
