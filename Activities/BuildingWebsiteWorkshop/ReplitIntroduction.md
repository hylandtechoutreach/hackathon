    - Skip the coding tutorial for now

That's it! You now have a Repl account ðŸ˜Š

## Forking a Starter Repl Project
On Replit, you can make a lot of different things. To work on something new, you'll want to create a **Repl Project** (also simply called a **Repl**). This will be where you store all of the code for your project, be it a website, C# application, or Python script!

For the purposes of this workshop, you can **fork** an existing repl. This lets you create a copy of someone else's code, and modify it to make it your own!

1. Open the [WebWave Starter Repl Project](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/WebWave)
1. In the upper right, click the blue "Fork Repl" button

1. In the bottom right of the pop-up, click the blue "Fork Repl" button again

That's it! You now have your own Repl project ðŸ˜Š

## Repl Workspace Overview
If this is your first Repl project, there may be an interactive click-through tutorial explaining the basics of the Repl Workspace. Feel free to step through it; it will explain how Replit works in more detail.

Here is a quick rundown of the different areas of a Repl:

- **Code Editor**: This is where you write code. The editor helps you by giving you suggestions and coloring your code.
- **Run Button**: Tap the Run button to execute your code and see its output.
- **Output**: This is where your run output appears. This can be text, websites, games, and more depending on the template you're using.
- **Sidebar**: The sidebar contains your **Files** and **Tools** - you will have all these nifty resources at your disposal when building your projects.
- **Invite Button**: This is where you can add collaborators to your project using the **Multiplayer** feature.

In the new repl, click the "Run" button to see the code execute. It should say "Hello World" in the output area!

## Multiplayer
One of the most powerful features of Replit is **Multiplayer**. This allows multiple users to edit a Repl project simultaneously! It's kind of like Google Docs but with code. When you're working on a team, this is an easy way to collaborate.

1. In the main Repl workspace, click the "Invite" button in the upper right  
    ![](Assets/WorkspaceInviteButton.png)
1. In the pop-up that appears, enter an email address or Replit username for a team member
1. Click the blue "Invite" button in the upper right
    ![](Assets/InviteMembers.png)
1. Repeat for each person on the team
1. Alternatively, click the "Generate a join link" button  
    ![](Assets/GenJoinLinkButton.png)
1. Click the "Copy" button for the link  
    ![](Assets/CopyJoinLink.png)
1. Share the link with your whole team

When in Multiplayer mode, you can click the "Chat" button in the upper right to chat with team members right inside the Repl!

## Conclusion
At this point you should be good to go, and ready to start developing on Replit! Make sure to remember your Replit username and password - those credentials will allow you to keep track of all your projects ðŸ˜Š
