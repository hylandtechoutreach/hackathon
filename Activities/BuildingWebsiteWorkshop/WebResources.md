## W3 Schools Tutorials
For a simple introduction to web concepts, [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is a good resource. They have a ton of tutorials and references! Here are some helpful starting points:

If you ever want to do something on a website, you can open up [google](https://google.com/) and type in a search topic followed by `html`. You'll almost definitely end up seeing a W3 Schools link in the results! They provide a bunch of simple examples that can get you up and running quickly.

## Interactive Courses on Codecademy
For a little more guided learning, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) has some excellent interactive courses. These may require a little more dedicated time, but they can provide a very well-rounded view of many concepts. Note that an account is required, but many of the courses available are totally free. Here are some helpful starting points:

## MDN Reference
MDN Web Docs is the most robust collection of web reference material available anywhere online. It is more technical and rigorous, but it goes deep into all of the concepts that are fundamental to web development. MDN documentation is an excellent way to gain a truly deep understanding of the web, but it might be a little less friendly to beginners.
