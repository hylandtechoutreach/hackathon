# Session: Choosing a Tech Stack
This lesson is designed to help teams choose a tech stack for their projects.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Clarify their project goals
- Understand the tradeoffs between different tech stacks
- Decide which tech stack is best based on their goals
- Be empowered to kick start their projects

## Presentation
The whole session runs through the [PowerPoint Presentation](ChoosingATechStack.pptx). This includes the following elements:

- **Lecture**
- **Resources Overview**
- **Q&A**

## Lecture
The lecture introduces a variety of tech stacks. Students should view each stack through the frame of their team's goals and other important factors like prior knowledge, industrial use, mentor experience, and ease of onboarding.

The lecture should be interactive - try to ask students about their goals, experience, and opinions. They themselves may have valuable insights about different technologies or development processes.

## Resources Overview
The [resources guide](Resources.md) should help students dig deeper into the tradeoffs between different stacks. It also provides links to some tutorials that will help students get their projects off the ground after they have chosen a stack.

## Q&A
Make sure to take some time at the end to answer any questions the students may have.
