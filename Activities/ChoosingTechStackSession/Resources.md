# Resources
These resources can help you decide which stack is best for you, and jump start the development of your project!

## Decisions
You'll have a lot of decisions to make before you begin...

### Native
If you want to make a desktop application, a mobile app, a game, or something else, we encourage that! Just make sure you know what you're doing, and know that depending on the technology you choose, there may be limited support available.

### Web Options
If you do decide to build a web application of some kind, the decisions won't end there! You'll need to choose your stack.

    - [A Few Good Ones](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Web_frameworks#a_few_good_web_frameworks)
- [Choosing a **Front-End** Web Framework](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks)

We recommend using a stack where each component technology works well together. It is certainly possible to mix and match; just make sure to consider the support available for any stack you choose. Some well-established stacks include:

#### JavaScript Based
- Node.js + Express + EJS
- MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
    - Also MEAN and MEVN (subbing Angular/Vue for React)

#### Python Based
- Flask + SQLite
- Django + MySQL

## Tutorials
There are a ton of tutorials available online - here are a few examples. If you don't see one that applies directly, Google will probably be able to help out!

### Combinations
These tutorials combine a few different components - this may be especially helpful for full-stack applications. This can be a good place to begin if you want to start up quick.
