## Puzzle 4: Weekday Lies
Thursday

### Explanation
Because Caitlin says she is lying, you know it can only be Monday or Thursday. Because Marissa says she is lying, you know it can only be Thursday or Sunday. Therefore, it must be **Thursday**.

## Puzzle 5: Candy Boxes
Ask Allie: "If I asked Matt if he holds the candy box, would he say 'yes' or 'no'?" (note: You could also flip the mentors)

### Explanation
There are four possible situations to consider:

- Situation 1: Allie is the liar, and she DOES hold the candy box. She would say "yes" because she knows Matt would say "no"
- Situation 2: Allie is the liar, and she does NOT hold the candy box. She would say "no" because she knows Matt would say "yes"
- Situation 3: Allie is the truth-teller, and she DOES hold the candy box. She would say "yes" because she knows Matt would say "yes"
- Situation 4: Allie is the truth-teller, and she does NOT hold the candy box. She would say "no" because she knows Matt would say "no" because she knows Matt would say "no"

So, if Allie says "yes" - you know that she holds the candy box. If Allie says "no" - you know that Matt holds the candy box.

## Puzzle 6: Candy Theft
"You will make me watch Shrek The Third on repeat for 10 hours."

### Explanation
If the statement were _false_, that would mean the student would have to watch Shrek The Third on repeat for 10 hours - thus making the statement _true_. If the statement were _true_, that would mean the student would not have to watch Shrek The Third on repeat for 10 hours, making it _false_. It is a **logical paradox**, so J would not be able to figure it out, thereby allowing the student to roam free.
