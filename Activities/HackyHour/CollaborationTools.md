## Replit Multiplayer
[Replit](https://replit.com) is an online development environment that supports a wide variety of languages, including HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Python, Node.js, C#, and Java.

One of the features on Replit is something called [Multiplayer](https://replit.com/site/multiplayer). It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously!

A Replit account is required for everyone who wants to participate, but from there, setup is a breeze. It's completely free, and everything takes place in a web browser. It's kind of like Google Docs but for coding. The development environment itself may not be quite as nice as others, but it's simple and generally effective.

## Visual Studio Live Share
Visual Studio Live Share is a lot like Replit Multiplayer, but it works with desktop applications.

- **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)** is a full-featured IDE for Windows, and there is a free version available. It can take up a good amount of space, but it has really nice features.
- **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** is a more lightweight IDE for any platform. It has some really nice features, and generally runs a little better on slower machines.

**[Visual Studio Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/)** is available on both Visual Studio and VS Code. The big benefit is that the IDE features are really nice (significantly nicer than Replit). The drawback is that there is a more complex setup, and it might not work well for every machine.
