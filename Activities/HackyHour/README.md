# Activity: Hacky Hour
This activity is meant to welcome students into their Hackathon experience! They should get to know their fellow students all while having fun and preparing for the weekend ahead. 

## Polls Icebreaker
Present the [Poll Questions PowerPoint](PollQuestions.pptx).

For each question:

- Have students answer as a group
  - In-person: holding up fingers
  - Virtual: posting in chat
- Allow them to discuss
  - Encourage friendly debate
  - Add commentary if there is not much conversation
  - Call on individual students and ask why they chose their answers
- Spend about **2 minutes** on each slide

## Puzzles Challenge
Introduce the [Puzzles Challenge](PuzzlesChallenge.md), and give teams some time to work on it. They can submit their answers using [this form](https://forms.gle/aedwjijKghTF64Gu6).

Responses are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ODL_FzR7ZCLBX3GI3mSa4SOsSSANm9jCupubjog6Mb0/edit?resourcekey#gid=262958459).

## Drawasaurus Game
Drawasaurus is basically online Pictionary. One student (the drawer) will be given a text prompt, and attempt to draw a picture of it. The other students (the guessers) will have to guess what the drawer is drawing! Guessers who provide correct guesses earn points based on how quickly they answer, and the drawer earns points for each correct guess as well.

There should be approximately one room for every 25-30 students. It will likely be necessary to create at least 3-4 different rooms. Incognito browser windows, other browsers, or separate computers can make this possible.

## Workshops & Sessions Overview
Take some time to go over the [list of activities](../StudentDesc.md). Read through each description, and ask if the students have any questions.

## Presentation: Intro to Hackathons
The [Intro to Hackathons PowerPoint Presentation](IntroToHackathons.pptx) should be given to students who have not previously attended a Hackathon. Students can choose to depart the Hacky Hour before the presentation begins.

The lecture runs through some basic information, and also provides some advice and inspiration. There is a script for each slide in the notes. There is also a [video](IntroToHackathonsVideo.mp4) walking through the presentation. Note that the slides in the video have a different theme - but the content should be the same.
