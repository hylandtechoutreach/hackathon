# Session: Introduction to OpenAI
This session provides a high level overview of the OpenAI organization and introduces common AI concepts like deep learning and natural language processing. Use cases and examples for OpenAI's recently released public APIs (GPT-3, DALLÂ·E 2, ChatGPT) will help prepare students for the future of knowledge work.

## Presentation
Present the [PowerPoint](OpenAI_Session.pptx). During the DALL-E slideshow at the end (after taking questions), play a synthwave tune like [Home - We're Finally Landing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR6fECxF44I) in a browser tab if you want.

## Interactive live demo
If there is time, and ideally if [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is up, run through any use case live for the audience. Take lots of suggestions. Think Mad Libs.
