# Workshop: Unlocking the Command Line
This lesson introduces the command line/bash as a general idea. The students should gain some familiarity with the tool, and feel comfortable at least moving around directories. They should understand some basics about how commands work.

## Lecture
The lecture introduces the idea of the command line, and gets into a few of the most basic commands:

- `pwd`
- `ls`
- `cd`

### Replit Demo
As part of the lecture, show the commands in action. One of the simplest ways to do this is using the built-in Replit shell - it surfaces a terminal for a small virtual machine. There is a link to [this Repl project](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/ShellCommands) in the slides. There are also slide notes that contain instructions:

1. Click on the "Replit Shell" link: `https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/ShellCommands`
1. Fork the project
1. Open the Shell (under **Tools** -> **Shell** button)
1. Try out some basic commands: `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd`
1. Show how to use **TAB**, **UP**, and **Ctrl**+**C**
    1. An example for **Ctrl**+**C** could be running the `cmatrix` command and stopping it

## Self-Paced Work
There are two different things the students could try with the remaining time. Introduce each of these options, and then let the students work on whatever they choose.

### More Commands
The students can research some slightly more advanced commands using the [More Commands](MoreCommands.md) instructions file. For the most part, they should be able to figure them out. There are also some challenges for the students to try.

### Interactive Game
Instruct students to try the [Terminus game](http://www.mprat.org/Terminus/). The game reinforces basic command line concepts, and should increase their overall comfort level with the command line.
