# Intro to Hackathons
This workshop is for students who have not previously attended a hackathon.

The main part of the session is the content in the [PowerPoint](Presentation.pptx). With any remaining time:

- Let students ask questions - this is for them, so let them guide the session
- Demonstrate some of the tools and resources - Repl.it Multiplayer, VS Live Share, W3 Schools, Codecademy
- Walk through a coding activity - for total beginners, help them build a basic website on Repl.it
