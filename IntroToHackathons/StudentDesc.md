## Collaboration Tools
Want to figure out how to work with your team? Try one of these tools!

### Repl.it Multiplayer
[Repl.it](https://repl.it) is an online development environment that supports a wide variety of languages, including HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Python, Node.js, C#, and Java. One of the features on Repl.it is something called [Multiplayer](https://repl.it/site/multiplayer). It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously!

A Repl.it account is required for everyone who wants to participate, but from there, setup is a breeze. It's completely free, and everything takes place in a web browser. It's kind of like Google Docs but for coding. The development environment itself may not be quite as nice as others, but it's simple and generally effective.

### Visual Studio Live Share
Visual Studio Live Share is a lot like Repl.it Multiplayer, but it works with desktop applications.

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) is a full-featured IDE for Windows, and there is a free version available. It can take up a good amount of space, but it has really nice features.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a more lightweight IDE for any platform. It has some really nice features, and generally runs a little better on slower machines.

[Visual Studio Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) is available on both platforms. The big benefit is that the IDE features are really nice (significantly nicer than Repl.it). The drawback is that there is a more complex setup, and it might not work well on every machine.

## Learning Resources
If you've never coded before, or if you want to learn something new, or if you just want a refresher, try some of the resources below.

### All-Ages Coding from Code.org
If you're completely new to coding and want an easy way to get into it, there are some very friendly introductory activities from [code.org](https://code.org/hourofcode/overview). These activities are designed for kids from all ages. Create a dance party, explore artificial intelligence, or code something from Minecraft, Star Wars, Frozen, and more! These activities mostly use **block-based coding**, where you drag and drop blocks to make things happen. It can be a great place to start for beginners, and it's all free, with no account required.

### Building a Website with W3 Schools
Have you ever wanted to create your own website? It may not be as difficult as you think. Follow [this HTML tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) from W3 Schools to jump into web development. After learning HTML, try [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp), and then [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp).

The tutorials on W3 Schools are designed with beginners in mind. They may not always have the most cutting-edge information, but they can help you start building websites quickly, and it's all free, with no account required.

### Courses on Codecademy
Codecademy is a website with several different interactive courses covering a variety of languages. Many of their courses cost money, but there are also some free options. An account is required.

If you're not sure which language to learn, you can try taking [this quiz](https://www.codecademy.com/explore/sorting-quiz).

Some of the beginner-friendly free courses include:
- [How to Code](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-how-to-code)
- [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)
- [C#](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-sharp)
- [SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)
- [R](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r)

A full catalog of courses can be found [here](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/all).

### The Power of Google
No matter what it is you want to make, there are probably free learning resources available somewhere on the internet! Try searching on Google or YouTube to see what's out there.
