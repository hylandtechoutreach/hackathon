# Planning for 2023
Some thoughts and ideas for the 2023 Hyland Hackathon.

## Raffle
We should have a way to give raffle tickets to attendees for participating in different things, answering questions in workshops, etc. At the end of the hackathon, they can add their tickets to a bucket for a selection of different prizes. We can also offer prizes to the top earners of raffle tickets by a certain point in time. We can track these in a spreadsheet instead of using physical tickets, so that remote students and in-person students can both earn tickets. Not sure of the best way to have them submit their tickets for prizes... maybe a google form.

## Theme
I think we should theme everything and I think that theme should be [Synthwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthwave). We can use this as the aesthetic for promotional posters, signage, workshop content, background music, pretty much anything. I think having a theme will create more cohesion and immersion in the hackathon experience for the students. This theme does not necessarily have to inform the subject matter of their projects.

## Website
I think we should put everything the students need to know on one central website. Currently, it looks like the [Gitbook](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/hackathon) will be able to serve that purpose. I'd like there to be one central source of information for everybody. We can probably theme the site so it looks a little more fun (maybe synthwavey).

## Checkpoints
We might want to incorporate a mandatory checkpoint at some point, just to check in with each team and make sure they are still planning to submit a project. Maybe we could do this on Saturday night.

## Judging
I think we should consider the judging process and try to simplify it a bit. Maybe just do one round instead of two? I don't know.

## Tracks
We can establish different tracks for participants based on their experience and interests. I think we should have at least three tracks, so everybody feels like they have a bit of a choice. Perhaps students will be eligible for different prizes based on which track they choose. There could be separate discord channels for the different tracks, and some sessions designed specifically for one track or another. Maybe instead of separating HS and College, we can separate judging by tracks. 

### Explorer
This track is for students who are just beginning their journey into the world of software development! They should be eager to learn and grow their skills. Any student who does not have moderate programming experience should select this track. Maybe students in this track should compete individually.

### Artisan
This track is for students who have a moderate amount of programming experience. They care about the creative aspects of software, and may be interested in design, innovation, and ideation.

### Scientist
This track is for students who love the technical details of software projects. They have significant programming experience, and are ready to lead their teams to create something exciting and cutting edge.

## Session Pitches
We can create a number of workshops, sessions, and activities that make the hackathon feel a bit like a convention or a conference. These should prepare students to work on their projects, teach them new things, and enhance their overall experience. Students could also earn raffle tickets for each session or workshop they attend.

### Session: Intro to Hackathons
This session covers all the basics of hackathons. Students who have never attended a hackathon should attend this session (or, alternatively, watch the pre-recorded video).

### Workshop: Building a Website with HTML & CSS
This would be for those in the Explorer track especially. We could probably steal the [HTML & CSS coding activity](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/coding-activities/HtmlCssLesson.html), possibly with some updates to make it use a different IDE and possibly include JavaScript. The website could be a synthwave site.

### Workshop: Intro to Version Control (Basic)
For teams with a lot of beginners (e.g., those mostly in the Explorer and Artisan track), version control should be as simple as possible. We should recommend using an online IDE or VS Live Share. We can walk through the importance of version control, and show students how to use it.

This workshop could also include some discussion around tooling: showing Visual Studio Code as an example.

### Workshop: Intro to Version Control (Advanced)
This would be an updated version of the [Intro to Git](../IntroToGit/) workshop. Hopefully there will not be too much to update. This should be attended by those in the Scientist track who are not familiar with Git and/or GitHub.

### Session: Presentations
This demo could be attended by anyone without significant public speaking experience. Depending on the makeup of the team, it might make more sense for an Artisan to attend this session instead of a Scientist. We could probably just steal the [presentations lesson from the Capstone Hy-Tech Club course](https://hylandtechclub.com/capstone/PresentationsLesson/StudentDesc.html). Many teams have great software, but they don't win because they don't present it well. Sometimes, the pitch is just as important as the product. Some projects that aren't super interesting from a technical perspective end up winning because their ideas were great, and their presentations were excellent.

#### Caveat Activity: Improv Slideshow
Give volunteers a random slideshow, and have them present the slides as if they know what they're doing. This could be a fun way to make the presentations lesson more interactive, and volunteers could earn raffle tickets!

### Workshop: MongoDB
We could have students setup their own database in MongoDB Atlas, and show a bit about how they can interact with it (possibly using Replit). This would mainly be for the Artisan or Scientist tracks.

### Session: Making Synthwave Music with Functional Programming
This demo could be attended by anyone - it's just for fun! The idea is to show a bit of what's possible with functional programming. We can explain some basics of music theory and music synthesis, and then get into the code. Using [the Extempore language/environment](https://extemporelang.github.io/), we can work as a group to create a quick little synthwave track.

Students will not be asked to follow-along with the activity - they will simply watch and provide suggestions.

### Session: Binary and the Fundamental Unit of the Universe
This is an idea I have for a little presentation about how [binary data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_data) ultimately powers every piece of digital information/media. It could be a quick, fun little tech-talk-type thing; could possibly involve an interactive element.

### Activity: Blooket Corner
I think it would be fun to have some quick [Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/) competitions with quizzes that pertain to hackathon/Hyland information (or synthwave stuff). The winners could win extra raffle tickets. Both remote and in-person students would be able to participate.

### Activity: Trivia
This could be similar to Blooket, but more live trivia like what Marissa does.

### Activity: Drawasaurus
It would also be fun to do some [Drawasaurus](https://www.drawasaurus.org/) sessions. Again, the winners could earn raffle tickets. We could also try to incorporate some Hyland/hackathon terms. Both remote and in-person students would be able to participate.

### Activity: Drawphone
Another recreational activity: [Drawphone](https://drawphone.tannerkrewson.com/). This would be a lot like the other recreational activities. Both remote and in-person students would be able to participate.

### Activity: Movie Night
Play a movie in the auditorium for students to watch at some point. Maybe get popcorn for them too. This would probably only work for in-person students (I don't think we have the rights to stream a movie over Zoom).

### Activity: Knockout/Shootaround/3-on-3
Get a group together to play some knockout, or just shoot around, or play actual basketball. This would only work for in-person students.

### Activity: Karaoke
Clear out the auditorium and have students sign up to sing some songs! There are a ton of karaoke versions of songs available on YouTube, and the auditorium mics should work fine for this. We could cancel this if fewer than five people sign up.

### Activity: Mixer
A quick dance party for everybody to let loose and dance around. I don't know if anyone would actually want to do this at all, but maybe they do. Who knows. Play some synthwavey music.

### Ongoing Activity: Jigsaw Puzzle
Have a big puzzle that anyone can try to piece together throughout the weekend (make it themed in some way like [this](https://www.redbubble.com/i/jigsaw-puzzle/Outrun-by-DionBlaster/56584742.L4Q0T)).

### Ongoing Activity: Coloring Books
Have some thematic coloring books and colored pencils or crayons (pink, purple, green) available for students to grab. Or, simply print out pages and scatter them around the area.

### Other Sessions
We could allow any hackathon mentors or other Tech Outreach partisans to pitch workshops or sessions that may be of interest to the students.

#### Existing Activities
We could also steal some of the coding activities that already exist. Some of them that might be fun:

- [Twine](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/coding-activities/TwineLesson/TwineLesson.html)
    - Twine could also be used as a base for a full-fledged project
- [Command Line](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-201/CommandLine/StudentDesc.html)
    - The command line is a super valuable skill to have
- [Machine Learning](https://hytechcamps.github.io/machine-learning/FollowAlong.html)
    - The concept of machine learning is interesting and may have big implications
- [User Experience](https://hylandtechclub.com/capstone/UserExperienceLesson/StudentDesc.html)
    - This would be relevant to all of their projects
- [MakeCode Arcade](https://hytechcamps.github.io/retro-games/CodeAlong.html)
- [Piskel](https://github.com/hylandtechoutreach/ucs/blob/master/Piskel/PiskelDemo.md)

#### YouTube Videos
We could find some fun computer science videos to play for the students, maybe during meals or in a separate room at certain times.

## Marketing
We have set a fairly ambitious goal: to see 120 students attend the hackathon. For better or worse, achieving that goal will likely require a substantial marketing effort.

### Main Talking Points
I've been considering some basic talking points when attempting to sell the idea of the hackathon.

Basic information:

- What: Software Development Competition
- When: January 6th through 8th (overnight)
- Where: In-Person at Hyland HQ in Westlake OH, or Remote
- Who: High School and College Students - Team-based, any skill level
- How: Hyland employees as mentors, teams submit projects, judges pick winners
- Cost: Free

Reasons to attend:

- Win fabulous prizes
- Eat free meals and snacks
- Attend eye-opening workshops and sessions
- Participate in fun activities
- Spend time with friends, or make new friends
- Build up your resume for job or college applications

### Flyer
I think a flyer is the most essential form of marketing we have. We can share it on social media, print out copies for schools, and use it for pretty much everything.

### Narrative Video
I have an idea for a narrative-based video that introduces all the key points for the hackathon in a slightly different way. We could make it synthwave themed and cool, try to give it a bit of a story, but express all the important talking bits as well. I have a vision for this that should be possible to achieve without too much difficulty.

### Sketch Video
I have another idea for one of those sketches where a person plays two different people. It would be me (playing myself) talk to myself (playing a student). I would try to get across all the main points, but make it somewhat silly. I think it could be a fun way to get the word out a bit.

### Informational Video
We could make another basic "hype" video as well. We did this last year - I don't know if it helped at all, but I was pretty happy with how the video turned out.

### Outreach
We can reach out to some specific groups to try to spread the word about the event. I think it is super important for us to give ourselves some lead time with this; especially when we aren't reaching students directly. Teachers may need an extra few weeks to catch our e-mail, print out a flyer, share info with students, etc. Here are some groups we could target:

- Students who have attended in the past
    - Try to personalize the messages, reach out and ask why or why not they chose to attend
- Teachers who have visited with field trips
    - We could send them flyers (or even deliver them and put them up directly)
    - We could target other CS teachers in the area
- College clubs
    - I don't know if we do this, but any CS clubs like ACM
- Students who have attended other hackathons
    - I don't know how to get this information but it could be helpful

### Incentivization
We may be able to think of some additional incentives we can offer, beyond the prizes, free food, free learning, etc. Maybe we could partner with teachers to offer extra credit for students who attend. Maybe we could provide exclusive access to an emerging technology like GPT-3, DALL-E 2, GitHub Copilot, or AWS. Maybe we could pay the AWS hosting costs for the winning project.

### Hashtag
This may not actually help us recruit participants, but I think it would be fun to have a hackathon hashtag. It could be themed in some way, help us generate material for the future, and add another touchpoint for the students. It could be something simple like `HylandHack2023`, and we could check Twitter and Instagram to see if anyone uses it.
