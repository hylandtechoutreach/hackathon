## Welcome
When you're ready to start hacking, review this welcome message from the event coordinators.

>Hyland thanks you for your participation in this year's Hackathon. Your ardent support enables us to fulfill our mission and expand the power of computer science education. The task before you is no small undertaking: to venture forth into the unknown, seeking new horizons, forging new connections, and exploring new paradigms, all in an effort to create something that has never existed before. This objective may seem daunting, but we are fully confident in your ability to achieve it. You will have the aid of your peers, your Hyland mentors, and untold resources every step of the way. We know that your development will take you further than you might imagine possible, and you'll have a ton of fun too. Best of luck, we believe in you!
