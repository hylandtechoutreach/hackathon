# Intro to Git Workshop
A workshop to introduce students to Git and GitHub. The goal is for each student to leave with a basic understanding of Git, as well their own repository on GitHub and the ability to push and pull changes.

## Lecture - PowerPoint Presentation
Start the lesson by presenting the [PowerPoint](Presentation.pptx). Be sure to read through all the notes in the slides, and be conscious of the animations. There are a few questions / quizzes built into the presentation - give students a chance to answer questions as much as possible. Students who answer questions should receive points.

## Guided Learning - Hello World
Next, it's time for some hands-on activities. Each student should [create their own GitHub Account](MakeAGitHubAccount.md), and [create their own repository](HelloWorld.md). Walk through these instructions as a group. The students should be able to complete these using only a web browser.

## Independent Work - Local Practice
For the next few activities, students will have to follow different instructions depending on their operating system and chosen setup. Encourage them to use Visual Studio Code or the command line for this section. Students should work independently on these activities, and then an instructor should walk through them with the group.

- [Install Git and Clone the Repository Locally](LocalSetup.md)
- [Push a Change from the Clone to the Server Repository](PushChanges.md)
- [Pull a Change from the Server Repository to the Clone](PullChanges.md)

## Assessment - Kahoot Quiz
Toward the end of the session, or after each student has practiced pushing and pulling changes between their clone and server repository, facilitate a [Kahoot Quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/details/intro-to-git-review/65637e11-a02d-4a8a-b24f-73d53316e6e0). Students who place in the top 3 should receive points.

## Closing - Resources
Finally, go over some of the [resources](Resources.md) with the students. If they want to use GitHub for their project, but want to learn more about collaboration, make sure to point out the [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) link. It is the first resource listed, and includes an interactive tutorial on branching. Beyond that, the students should feel free to ask any questions, and visit any resources they would like.
