# What to Bring
_In order to complete your mission, you will need to ensure you are well-equipped to handle any possible eventuality._

## In-Person Packing
Here are some things we recommend bringing if you will be attending in-person:

- A computer (laptop or desktop) and charger
- A cell phone and charger
- Headphones
- Post-it notes, dry-erase markers, pens, notebooks
- A gaming console or other leisure-time activities (playing cards, etc)
- Your own food if you have dietary restrictions
  - There are fridges and microwaves available
- A water bottle
- A sweatshirt
  - It can get chilly in the office!
- A sleeping bag
- An air mattress or yoga mat
  - Couch access will be limited
- A pillow
- A blanket
- Slippers
- A change of clothes
  - Remember, you'll have to present to the judges
- A towel, soap, and shower shoes if you plan on showering
- Deodorant
- Toothbrush & toothpaste

This is by no means an exhaustive list; feel free to bring whatever you need to make sure you are comfortable.

## Virtual Packing
If you are virtual, all you should need is a sufficiently powerful computer (i.e., something more than a chromebook), an internet connection, and a positive outlook.
