# Workshop: Presenting Presentations
This workshop is designed to provide some guidance to students who will be demonstrating their software as a team.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Identify qualities of a good presentation, _and_ a bad presentation
- Prepare adequately to present in front of stakeholders
- Create presentation materials as needed

## Lecture 1: Bad Presentation
Present the [Bad Presentation PowerPoint](BadPresentation.pptx). It is purposefully designed to be bad. Read off the slides, don't look at the audience, don't introduce the topic... try to do a bad job. Maybe even switch presenters halfway through without the other presenter knowing they would be presenting.

## Demo: Bad
There is also a piece of software to try and demonstrate - do as little preparation as possible to demonstrate this.

1. Load up [this project](https://replit.com/@JosephMaxwell/Chase-Project#app.js)
    - Fork it if needed
1. Try to run it - it should fail
1. Uncomment line 2 to make it run
1. Don't explain anything about what it does
1. Click "Add a player"
1. Enter gibberish
1. Don't explain what's happening
1. Edit and Delete a player
1. End prematurely and do not ask if anyone has questions

## Discussion
After the "bad" lecture and demo, **ask students what could have gone better**. Talk about some of the differences between a good presentation and a bad presentation.

## Lecture 2: Corrections
Present the [Presentations PowerPoint](Presentations.pptx). It should be slightly better, and emphasize the important lessons learned from the first one. There are talking points in the slides.

## Slideshow Shuffle
This activity is also called ["PowerPoint karaoke"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPoint_karaoke): the goal is for students to present slideshows they have never seen before!

### PowerPoints
Here are some available PowerPoints:

- [Minimalism](ShuffleSlides/Minimalism.pptx)
- [The Meaning of Art](ShuffleSlides/Art.pptx)
- [How To Make Friends](ShuffleSlides/Friends.pptx)
- [The Number Four](ShuffleSlides/Four.pptx)
- [Interior Design for Beginners](ShuffleSlides/InteriorDesign.pptx)
- [How To Make A Splash In The World Of Business](ShuffleSlides/Business.pptx)

### Facilitation
Follow this process to facilitate the activity:

1. Make sure all the presentations are downloaded and opened
1. Show students the list of presentation titles (on the [workshop homepage](StudentDesc.md))
1. Ask for students to volunteer to present, and let them choose from the list of lectures
1. Put the chosen PowerPoint in presentation mode, and control the flow through the slides
    - Try to keep each lecture around **3 minutes** (about 30 seconds per slide)
    - Don't let any students get too far off the rails
    - Make sure each student adds at least _some_ original commentary for each slide

The activity is meant to be strictly for fun, so hopefully the students enjoy it!
