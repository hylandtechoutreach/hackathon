# Session: Programming Synthwave Music
This interactive session shows how to use functional programming to create synthwave music. In-person students should close their computers and participate in the live session; virtual students should simply watch the Zoom meeting and contribute via chat. This is not designed to be a "follow-along" session.

## Introduction
For an introduction to Synthwave Programming, present the [PowerPoint](SynthwaveProgramming.pptx). There are notes in the slides with talking points.

## Demonstration
Walk through the [Demonstration Guide](DemonstrationGuide.md) and perform the actions for the audience. There are a few things to note:

- Students should **NOT** attempt to follow along
  - They should simply watch and participate
  - They can try to set it up after the session if they would like
- The **Setup** section should be completed before the session begins
  - **Musical Hello World** should be the first thing
- Zen Mode in Visual Studio Code can be used
  - `Ctrl`+`K`, `Z` will enter and exit zen mode
  - Files can be opened with `Ctrl`+`P`
- Ask for participant input as much as possible
  - Tempo
  - Notes
  - Effect Values
- Don't worry about explaining the code too much
  - It's more about the experience of hearing it come to life
- Messing with chords and parameter values is the most fun part

## Conclusion
After the demo, conclude the session with some potential next steps:

- Show [examples of Synthwave](SynthwaveExamples.md)
- Show the [Demonstration Guide](DemonstrationGuide.md)
- Show [resources for Extempore](ExtemporeReferences.md)

If they want help getting Extempore up and running, they can reach out to Joseph Maxwell, aka the person writing this ðŸ˜Ž
