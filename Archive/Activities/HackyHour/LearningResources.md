If you've never coded before, or if you want to learn something new, or if you just want a refresher, try some of the resources below.

## All-Ages Coding from Code.org
If you're completely new to coding and want an easy way to get into it, there are some very friendly introductory activities from [code.org](https://code.org/hourofcode/overview).

These activities are designed for kids from all ages. Create a dance party, explore artificial intelligence, or code something from Minecraft, Star Wars, Frozen, and more! 

These activities mostly use **block-based coding**, where you drag and drop blocks to make things happen. It can be a great place to start for beginners, and it's all free, with no account required.
